# Todo's and some crazy ideas (grouped).

## User experience (UX):

- [ ] Update the User Manual. In 1997, Richard Stallman wrote: “The biggest deficiency in free operating systems is not in the software — it is the lack of good free manuals that we can include in these systems.”

   - [x] Include a chapter on the Topological router in User Manual.

   - [ ] Include DJ's Getting Started in the User Manual.

   - [ ] Extend Getting Started for both autorouter and topological router.

   - [ ] Add more step-by-step / tutorials / examples for existing exporters:

      - [ ] Usage of Nelma.

      - [ ] Usage of GSvit.

   - [ ] Usage of Blind and buried vias.

   - [ ] Appendix B: add chapter B.10 Problems related to Microsoft Windows.

- [ ] I18n / L11n:

   - [ ] Get more translators --> better and more language translations.

   - [ ] Update the Dutch translations.

   - [ ] Update the French translations.

   - [ ] Update the Cyrillic translations.

   - [ ] Use Launchpad for common translations.

   - [ ] Check on what should be translatable strings.

   - [ ] Check on plural forms in exotic languages (Japanese, etc).

   - [ ] Respect "Right-To-Left" reading users (Arabic, GUI layouts ?).

- [ ] Unify and combine the READMEs.

- [ ] Assist the User with repetitive tasks.

- [ ] Routing:

   - [ ] Respect the "outline", "invisible", "route" and non-copper layers with the autorouter.

   - [ ] Respect the "outline", "invisible", "route" and non-copper layers with the toporouter.

   - [ ] Add via placement to the toporouter.

   - [ ] Respect the "keepout" layer.

   - [ ] Importing routing style and other data from the netlist (if available).

- [ ] GUIs:

   - [ ] Implement the "lessgtk" GUI:

      - [ ] Separate layout window for artwork (primary screen).

      - [ ] Separate window for button box and pull-down menu-items (secondary screen).

      - [ ] Activate button box (popup dialog) with Right Mouse Button (RMB).

   - [ ] More routing styles (in pull-down combo-box ?).

   - [ ] Make the use and visibility of the trackball configurable.

   - [ ] HTML5 (+java) GUI (web based pcb layout designer).

   - [ ] Android GUI for tablets and smart-phones.

   - [ ] GTK3 GUI.

   - [ ] GTK4 GUI.

   - [ ] QT3 GUI.

   - [ ] QT4 GUI.

   - [ ] QT5 GUI.

   - [ ] wxWindows GUI for native Microsoft windows look-and-feel UX.

- [ ] Netlist:

   - [ ] Layout vs netlist/schematic check or just trust the "import schematic" netlist.

   - [ ] Rebuilding a netlist from scratch, based on connectivity of copper layers/wire bridges.

   - [ ] Introduce a "wire" layer for wire bridges.

   - [ ] Connectivity for wire bridges.

   - [ ] Add a configurable watch for the source schematics. If the source is newer than pcb layout (on startup/during layout time) update the netlist [Off, Auto-mode or Interactive-mode (popup dialog)].

- [ ] Layer definition awareness (copper, non-copper, soldermask, comments, silk, outline, anti-mask, keepout).

- [ ] Editable soldermask (gang solder mask clearance … for QFP, SO, PLCC, etc. package types).

- [ ] Grouping of elements, traces and vias.

- [ ] Show / define solder paste (per pad, per part, per footprint, global percentage of pad area, etc.).

- [ ] Show / define IPC-356-D test points.

- [ ] Back annotation (output).

- [ ] Pin swapping.

- [ ] Pinout awareness (in, out, inout, pas, pwr extracted from gschem schematic).

- [ ] Routing style awareness of traces (and watch dog functionality if a routing style definition is changed !).

- [ ] Padstack definitions.

- [ ] Layer stackup definitions.

- [ ] Create multiple pcb executables during build time (bpcb for batch, gpcb for GTK, lpcb for lesstif).

- [ ] Multiple Document Interface mode (lessGTK UI ?).

- [ ] Multiple Document Interface mode (lesstif UI ?).

## Road map: 

* It's releatively easy to re-schedule Launchpad bug reports and switch
  them to other releases. 

* Minor version number increments apply to releases requiring pcb native
  file format changes, micro version number increments apply to releases
  without pcb native file format changes.
