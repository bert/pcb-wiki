PCB is an interactive printed circuit board editor for the X11 window system with either a GTK interface (default) or a lesstif interface.

PCB includes a rats nest feature, Blind and Buried vias, and Design Rule Checking.

PCB offers high end features such as an autorouter, a topological router and a trace optimizer which can tremendously reduce layout time.

Plug-ins: compile separately and load at startup of pcb.

PCB includes exporters for:

- <b>Batch</b>: text line "batch" HID, which exists for scripting and non-GUI needs.

- <b>Gerber</b>: Industry standard RS-274-X and NC drill output.

- <b>BOM</b>: Bill of material and centroid data X-Y data output for use in the board fabrication and assembly process.

- <b>PS</b>: PostScript output.

- <b>PNG</b>: GIF, JPG and PNG graphic formats output.

- <b>[Nelma](https://www.tablix.org/~avian/nelma/)</b>: Export output files for trace capacitance calculations.

- <b>[GSvit](http://gsvit.net/)</b>: Export output files for Finite Difference in Time Domain calculations (FDTD).

- <b>IPC-D-356</b>: Netlister with output conforming to the IPC-D-356 standard rev. 0.
