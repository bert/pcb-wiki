# Luciani.org PCB Footprint FAQ

## Installation

### I have your footprint library. How do I install it?

I create a single directory for PCB footprints. In this directory I place footprint files and symlinks to footprint files.

To create a PCB from a schematic I run the following command:

```
gsch2pcb --use-files --elements-dir PACKAGE_DIR SCHEMATIC_FILENAME
```

where <b>PACKAGE_DIR</b> is the name of the PCB footprint directory and <b>SCHEMATIC_FILENAME</b> is the name of the gschem schematic file to to be used to create the PCB.

Alternatively, if you create a PCB project file you can define a set of search directories. The gEDA/PCB Tutorial contains information about how to create project files.

I prefer to place all "production-ready" footprints in a single directory that is not in the PCB install tree. When a new version of PCB comes out I do not make any changes to project files or libraries. If there are newlib parts in the PCB library that I want to use I can symlink (or copy) them to the "production-ready" footprint directory. If there are oldlib parts that I want to use I use this script to extract the element commands to a file.

## Documentation

Documentation relating to my Perl library.

### When using xpdf to view the Perl library documentation the Full Screen button doesn't work. Why?

I do not know. For best viewing download Adobe Acrobat for Linux [here](https://www.adobe.com/)

### When using xpdf to view the Perl library documentation the external hyperlinks in the Bibliography section are broken. Why?

## M4 Libraries

### How do I force gsch2pcb to look for file footprints before m4 footprints?

Use the <b>--use-files</b> switch on the gsch2pcb command line.

### How do I view the element commands used to create an oldlib footprint?

Run M4 on the package file.

The following script is from the PCB documentation (with minor modifications):

```
#!/bin/bash

PCB_M4_DIR=/local/pub/pcb-20040215/share/pcb/m4

for package in $@
do
echo "PKG_$package(\"\", \"\", \"\")" | \
   m4 -I$PCB_M4_DIR common.m4 - | \
   awk '/^[ \t]*$/ {next} {print}' | \
   more
done
```

Modify PCB_M4_DIR to match your environment.

### Where is the path to the M4 footprint libraries set?

The path is set in the (define m4-pcbdir "") line in the following files:

```
MY_GEDA_DIR/share/gEDA/scheme/gnet-PCBboard.scm
MY_GEDA_DIR/share/gEDA/scheme/gnet-gsch2pcb.scm
```

where <b>MY_GEDA_DIR</b> is the directory where you installed the gEDA suite.

for gsch2pcb you can explicitly set the M4 footprint library on the command line -

gsch2pcb --m4-pcbdir YOUR_M4_PACKAGE_DIR --elements-dir YOUR_NEWLIB_PACKAGE_DIR SCH_FILE_NAME
