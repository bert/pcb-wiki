# How to get PCB ?

This page contains information about how to download and install PCB on your computer.

## Prerequisites

### Operating System

Currently PCB runs on unix like operating systems such as Linux, NetBSD, Solaris, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, etc. In addition PCB will work on a windows computer using cygwin. It is also possible to compile PCB using mingw on windows using the win32/build_pcb.sh script.

### Installing a Pre-Built Package

#### Debian

```
apt-get install pcb
```

#### Fedora

To automatically download and install the latest version (and dependencies) from one of the (pre-configured) Fedora repositories:

```
yum install pcb
```

For the installation with yum you need administrator-privileges.

To install a manually downloaded rpm:

```
yum localinstall <rpmfilename>
```

Where <rpmfilename> is the downloaded rpm of your choice. Required dependencies need to be downloaded and installed simultaneously, or beforehand.

"localinstall" is used to install a set of local rpm files. If required the enabled repositories will be used to resolve dependencies. Note that the install command will do a local install, if given a filename. This option is maintained for legacy reasons only.

"localupdate" is used to update the system by specifying local rpm files. Only the specified rpm files of which an older version is already installed will be installed, the remaining specified packages will be ignored. If required the enabled repositories will be used to resolve dependencies. Note that the update command will do a local update, if given a filename. This option is maintained for legacy reasons only.

#### Gentoo

```
emerge pcb
```

#### NetBSD

See [ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/current/pkgsrc/cad/pcb/README.html](ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/current/pkgsrc/cad/pcb/README.html).

#### Ubuntu

... to be added.

### External Libraries

- GUI toolkit. Currently PCB supports either gtk or lesstif/motif based guis. If you are using the GTK based gui, you will need gtk-2.4.0 or newer. If you are using the lesstif based gui you will need lesstif, openmotif, or motif.
- If you wish to export your layout to png, jpeg, or gif formats you will need the GD library. If you do not have this library you will need to disable the png HID at configure time.
- GNU m4. In particular your m4 must support -F for frozen files.
wish (part of tcl/tk). If not installed, set WISH=/bin/false in your configure environment and you just won't get the graphical QFP footprint builder
- A suitable make program. GNU make will work as will the make which comes with NetBSD and some of the other *BSD operating systems. Other system make programs have not been tested.
   - flex
   - bison
- A C compiler. Although most development of PCB is done using gcc, PCB is known to build with the Sun Studio C compiler.

### Download the Sources from [Released files](https://github.com/bert/pcb/wiki/2.0-Released-files)

PCB is distributed in source code format. Periodic releases are made which help the average user build and install the software. The latest releases may be found on the PCB [Released files](https://github.com/bert/pcb/wiki/2.0-Released-files) page.

### Tracking the Latest

PCB uses git for source code management. For more information on the git repository used by PCB see the gEDA scm wiki page

To perform an initial check out of PCB sources via anonymous GIT, run the following:

```
git clone git://git.geda-project.org/pcb.git
```

In addition (for those who don't have git), you may obtain the latest sources via anonymous CVS. To perform an initial check out of PCB sources via anonymous CVS, run the following:

```
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@git.geda-project.org/home/git/pcb.git co master
```

If you have a checked out source tree from the sourceforge anonymous CVS repository, then you will need to replace the contents of all the CVS/Root files with:

```
:pserver:anonymous@git.geda-project.org/home/git/pcb.git
```

A shell script can automate that procedure.

Users intending to do development work on PCB, and/or submit patches should ideally check out from the git repository.

Those who wish to build from CVS or git sources instead of one of the snapshots should read the README.git in the top of the source tree for instructions. Note that for most users, the snapshot releases should be sufficient.

## Building and Installing from Source

### Unpacking the tarball

Place the tarball (pcb-x.y.z.tar.gz) in a temporary directory.

(where x.y.z is the version)

Unpack the tarball with:

```
tar -xvzf pcb-x.y.z.tar.gz
```

### Building pcb from Source

```
./configure --disable-update-desktop-database --disable-update-mime-database --with-gui=gtk 
make
make distcheck
```

### Installing pcb

```
make install
```

This requires sudo rights.
