\* These class letters would not appear in a parts list as they are part of a PCB and not an active electronic component.

** Not a class letter, but commonly used to designate test points for maintenance purposes.

Note: The above list is not exhaustive.
See the standard list of class designation letters in ANSI Y32.2/IEEE Std. 315,
Section 22 and the Index.
