# Footprint naming conventions

This section describes the conventions for naming of footprints used in PCB (and gEDA/gaf).
The purpose of the naming convention is to establish a standard to maintain the same naming convention through the different phases of the CAD chain. This helps in ensuring that the collaborative effort of gEDA/gaf is not lost.

## Notes

   - Unless otherwise noted, numerical pin names will be used, starting from 1.
   - n is for the pin count.
   - m is for the pin spacing in mils.
   - x is for the x dimension of the package (excluding pins). In particular this is used for the QFP package family.
   - SMT means surface mount, other components are through-hole.
