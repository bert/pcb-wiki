# Routing

## How do I route a connection from solder to component side and back?

While using the line tool, use the number keys on top of the keyboard to switch layers.
A via will be placed automatically at the endpoint of the last complete segment.

## How do I change the routing style?

There is a set of predefined sizes for routing.
The sets bear suggestive names (Signal, Power, Fat and Skinny).
Hit the button “Route Style” to configure the sizes of the current set to your needs.
You can set the names and the default values of these parameter sets in a config file ( ~/.pcb/settings for the [GTK-HID](http://wiki.geda-project.org/geda:glossary), or ~/.Xdefaults for the [Lesstif-HID](http://wiki.geda-project.org/geda:glossary)).

Example for such a setting:
```
route-styles = Signal,1000,3600,2000,1000:Power,2500,6000,3500,1000:Fat,4000,6000,3500,1000:Skinny,600,2402,1181,600
```
Be sure, to remove any route-style line in ~/.pcb/preferences .
Else, the line in settings will be ignored.

The line tool knows about different modes to deal with transversal connections.
The status line on the bottom of the page tells, which mode is in effect:

1. 45° plus vertical/horizontal (status line: “\_”)
2. vertical plus 45° (status line: “_/”)
3. either vertical or 45° (status line: “45”)
4. arbitrary angle (status line: “all”)

The way to access these modes differs among the GUI versions.
The current GTK snapshot (v20060288) defaults to “_/” but can be temporarily turned to “\_” with the <b>Shift</b> key.
You can switch to 45° mode with the slash key <b>/</b>.
For arbitrary angles, press the period key <b>.</b>, or choose 'All-direction' lines in the Setting menu.

## I got stuck! How do I go back?

The universal undo key U works even while in the middle of track layout actions.
It will remove the last segment but keep the line tool attached to the mouse.
So you can immediately go on routing and find a better way.

## How do I move one set of layer tracks to a different layer?

1. Select the tracks.
   It’s easiest to do this if you shut off everything but that layer first (i.e. silk, pins, other layers, etc).
2. Now set the current layer to be the new layer.
   Yes, the layer might get displayed; not a problem as you’ve already selected the tracks you want.
3. Press <b>Shift+M</b> to move all the selected tracks to the current layer.
