# Exporting Other Formats: Raster and PS Files

## What is xy-max in the PNG export dialog box?

It limits the size of the image to NxN pixels, but maintains the aspect
ratio.
For example, if you set it to 400, a 6000×8000 mil board would yield a
300×400 image, but a 6000×4500 board yields a 400×300 image.
