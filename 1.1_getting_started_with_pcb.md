# Getting Started with PCB

Note: This document does not replace the User manual that accompanies pcb, or the [gEDA-project.org wiki pages](http://wiki.geda-project.org/).

## Setting up pcb

A PCB distribution usually is set up so that PCB will automatically look in a packages subdirectory of the working directory. So, to make PCB find all the custom elements I put in gaf/pcb-elements I make a link in each of my project directories.
Note that this link is actually not required when using gsch2pcb because, as described below, you may alternatively specify the pcb-elements directory in a project file.
But if you do want to make the link, in directory gaf/myproject1 enter the command:

```
ln -s ../pcb-elements packages
```
