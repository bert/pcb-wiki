# Customization

## I don't like that old-style black background. How can I get a light canvas?

In GTK-HID there is a <b>Preferencesâ€¦</b> dialog in the <b>File</b> menu.

The <b>Colors</b> tab presents a convenient way to set all the colors
pcb uses via the standard GTK color chooser.

The colors are saved to $HOME/.pcb/preferences on shut down of the
application.

With Lesstif-HID there is no preference dialog.
Colors can be set in $HOME/.pcb/settings

## How do I set the default values of the postscript dialog?

You can set the default options of the postscript printing dialog as
command line parameters when invoking pcb.

Type ```pcb --help``` for a list of available options.
These options can also be set in a file $HOME/.pcb/settings.

A settings file for a4 paper, no alignment marks, multi page output
would contain:
```
media = A4
align-marks = 0
multi-file = 1
```

## How do I customize the mouse behavior?

There is no GUI way to modify the mouse behavior.
However, you can adapt it to your needs without recompiling.

This is how:

1. locate the file ```gpcb-menu.res``` on your box.
   For lesstif there is a similar file called ```pcb-menu.res```
2. copy the file to ```$HOME/.pcb```
3. edit to your needs, save
4. on start-up, pcb will read this localised copy.
   This will overwrite whatever settings were made by the system
   gpcb-menu.res

## How do I temporarily change keyboard shortcuts?

The GTK version of pcb includes a neat way to change shortcuts on the
fly:

1. go to the menu and let the mouse hover over the item to be configured.
   Don't press any mouse button.
2. type whatever shortcut you'd like to assign to the item under the mouse.
3. the shortcut will be working immediately.
   Conflicts with other shortcuts will be resolved by removing the
   shortcut of the conflicting definition.

This setting will be reset at the next session of pcb.

## How do I permanently change keyboard shortcuts?

Default keyboard shortcuts are defined in files called
```gpcb-menu.res``` if you use the default GTK interface.

On start-up pcb reads the configuration from a system path, e.g.
```/usr/local/share``` or ```/usr/share/```.

For permanent change of keyboard shortcuts you can copy the system file
to ```$HOME/.pcb/gpcb-menu.res``` and edit to your needs.

Settings in this file will overwrite the system configuration.

The lesstif interface reads ```pcb-menu.res``` files instead.

## Can I customize the menu?

The menu is defined in ```gpcb-menu.res``` for the GTK-UI.
You can place a localized copy in ```$HOME/.pcb/```.

See the notes above on configuration of keyboard shortcuts and mouse
behavior.
